# MACRO11
MACRO11 is an PDP-11 cross assembler, written in C.
Projects files are included only for Win32 platform MS Visual Studio 2015, as it's been used as part of PDP11GUI.

This MACRO11 was forked from Richard Krebiehls version in 2008. Thanks!
[Richard's version is here.](http://www.dbit.com/pub/pdp11/macro11/).

Changes since then:
* restructured the sources
* bugfixes
* added option "-listhex" to generate listings in hex instead of octal (helpful for work with modern logic analyzers).
