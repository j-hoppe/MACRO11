# MACRO11
<<<<<<< HEAD
MACRO11 is an PDP-11 cross assembler, written in C.
Projects files are included for MS Visual Studio, as it's been uses as part of  PDP11GUI.

This MACRO11 was forked from Richard Krebiehls version in 2008.
[It's here](http://www.dbit.com/pub/pdp11/macro11/).

Changes since then:
* restructured the sources
* bugfixes
* added option "-listhex" to generate listings in hex instead of octal (helpful for work with modern logic analyzers).

Also see the [MACRO11 page](http://www.retrocmp.com/tools/macro11).
